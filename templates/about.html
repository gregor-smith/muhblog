    <h1>What is this site?</h1>
    <p>Thoughts on video games mostly, sometimes television or programming too. Expect them to be nonsensical, unresearched, biased, shallow, hypocritical, etc, all the good stuff. If you have opinions or feedback and want to make a comment then too bad I guess because this is a very simple static site created with Frozen-Flask.</p>
    <h1>Who even are you?</h1>
    <p>Maybe one day I'll write personal stuff here. You could try contacting through one of the means listed below, but don't hold your breath for a reply.</p>
